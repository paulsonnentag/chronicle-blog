“Version control for everything” is our vision for the latest Ink & Switch research project.

The project is called Chronicle and features Geoffrey Litt, Paul Sonnetag, Max Schoening, Peter van Hardenberg, Orion Henry, and Adam Wiggins (that’s me—I’ll be reporting on this journey over the coming months).

Developers have discovered the power of change management via version control tools like Git and GitHub. Writers have some tools at their disposal as well, such as Microsoft Word’s “Track Changes” [mode](http://google.com).

But we believe that all tools should offer revision control out of the box. Writing, design, CAD, photo editing, video editing—creators of all types can benefit from reasoning about change as a first-class citizen.

We also think version control should be a tool for all users, not just the most committed nerds. So we'll be exploring the tradeoff between learning curve and a smoother writing/editing workflow.

Over the coming months we’ll be building a series of prototypes to test this idea. Subscribe to this page's RSS feed to get weekly updates!
